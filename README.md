Answer each of the following questions in the same Python file named `hw8-1.py`. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file.

Each question should consist of 2 lines. The first line should be a comment with `Question #` where the `#` is the number of the question. The next line should print the use of a statement that completes the desired task.
